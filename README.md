# rock_paper_scissors
This is my attempt at the rock, paper scissors game. It is browser-based, built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
This project focuses on clean game flow, state management, and user interaction without using any frameworks.

Features
- Interactive multi-screen UI (welcome, choice, results, exit)
- Click and keyboard controls (R / P / S)
- Prevents multiple selections per round
- Persistent score using localStorage
- Reset score functionality
- Clean and readable game logic

Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

How to Play
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click Yes to start the game
3. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors:
   - Click the buttons or
   - Press R, P, or S on your keyboard
4. View the result and updated score
5. Click Play again to continue

What I Learned
- Managing UI state with JavaScript
- Preventing unintended multiple user actions
- Using setTimeout for controlled game flow
- Persisting data using localStorage
- Handling keyboard and mouse events together
